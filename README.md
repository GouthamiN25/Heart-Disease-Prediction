# Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis is critical to improving patient outcomes, and machine learning can play a crucial role in accurately predicting the risk of heart disease. This project aims to create a predictive model using historical medical data, which includes key indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features, to assess the risk of heart disease.
